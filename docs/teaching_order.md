# Teaching Order

This document defines the order of teaching and explicitly states which language constructs are allowed and disallowed at each phase.

## Computational Thinking

### Allowed Constructs
- Function calls (the most basic statement)
- Return type of functions is void

### Disallowed Constructs
- Variables
- Constants

## Constants

### Allowed Constructs
- Passing explicit values (not variables) to functions
- Return type of functions is void

### Disallowed Constructs
- Variables

## Variables

### Allowed Constructs
- Constant variables that get passed to multiple functions
- Reassignment to these variables (with constant values, not the result of functions)

### Disallowed Constructs
- Non-void return types

## Non-void Return Types

### Allowed Constructs
- Non-void return types which can be stored

### Disallowed Constructs
- None

## Defining Functions

### Allowed Constructs
- Defining functions yourself
- Transfer of values passed as arguments to parameter variables
- Passing variables as arguments

### Disallowed Constructs
- None
