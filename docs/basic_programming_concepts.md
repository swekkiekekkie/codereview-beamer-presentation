# Basic Programming Concepts

## Variables
Variables are used to store data. In C#, you can declare and initialize variables as follows:
```csharp
int x = 5;
string name = "John";
```

## Data Types
Data types define the type of data a variable can hold. Here are some examples of data types in C#:
```csharp
int age = 30;
double salary = 50000.50;
bool isEmployed = true;
```

## Control Flow
Control flow statements control the order in which instructions are executed. Here is an example of an if-else statement in C#:
```csharp
if (age > 18) {
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("Minor");
}
```
