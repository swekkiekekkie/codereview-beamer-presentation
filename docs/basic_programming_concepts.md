# Basic Programming Concepts

## Variables
Variables are used to store data. In C#, you can declare and initialize variables as follows:
```csharp
int x = 5;
string name = "John";
```

## Data Types
Data types define the type of data a variable can hold. Here are some examples of data types in C#:
```csharp
int age = 30;
double salary = 50000.50;
bool isEmployed = true;
```

## Control Flow
Control flow statements control the order in which instructions are executed. Here is an example of an if-else statement in C#:
```csharp
if (age > 18) {
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("Minor");
}
```

## Computational Thinking
Computational thinking is a problem-solving process that involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems. This approach allows us to tackle each subproblem individually, making it easier to find solutions and implement them in a programming language.

### Example: Control Flow
The concept of control flow can be broken down into subproblems using if-else statements to handle different conditions.
```csharp
if (age > 18) {
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("Minor");
}
```
